            <h3>General Terms.</h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            This is an agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) between you and
            HartCode LLC, (&quot;HartCode&quot;) that governs your use of the
            HartCode Website (the website at &quot;hartcode.com&quot;), your
            purchase of Licenses, and your use of accounts and Game software
            (“Software”) through the HartCode Website. The Terms of Use for the
            HartCode Website, available at{' '}
            <a href="/terms-of-use">https://hartcode.com/terms-of-use</a> is
            fully incorporated into this Agreement by reference.

          <li>
            <h3>Description of Service.</h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            HartCode is proud to provide you with license-based online access to
            certain of its Games through Game software downloaded, streamed or
            otherwise provided to your computer via the Internet (the
            “Service”). HartCode will make select versions of certain of its
            games available for use through purchase of a License. Access to
            Games through the Service is license-based. Your License provides
            access only to one version of the game selected (&quot;Game&quot;).
            Therefore, there may be multiple Games for a given game. In order to
            access a new version of the game, you must purchase another License
            for that version. You may access the Game using your Account and
            either purchasing a License or using a Sub-License Code provided by
            an owner of a License. If you purchase access to one of our Games,
            you will receive a License to use the Game (“License”). To use your
            License(s) you will log into your Account and enter the access code
            (the “License Code”) associated with the License into the Game entry
            interface available on the HartCode Website. If you are using a
            Sub-License Code, you will log into your Account and enter the
            Sub-License Code into the Game entry interface available on the
            HartCode Website.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h3>Applications.</h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            Select Games may be available for download through the HartCode
            Website and/or third-party stores (“Applications”). You may download
            an Application for personal, non-commercial use only. By downloading
            an Application, HartCode is providing you a limited, non-exclusive,
            non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Application
            with or apart from the Service. By downloading an Application, you
            agree to be bound by this Agreement, including the Terms of Use and
            Privacy Policy incorporated herein, in addition to any third-party
            agreements to the extent such Application was downloaded from a
            third-party store.

            <h3>Account Eligibility.</h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            To purchase Licenses to or use the Games offered under this
            Agreement, you must register for a user account (an “Account”) on
            the HartCode Website. Accounts are available only to adult
            individuals 18 years of age or older. If you are less than 18 years
            of age and wish to use HartCode’s Licenses, your parent or legal
            guardian or an educator must complete the registration process, open
            an Account in their name, without providing personal information of
            anyone less than 18 years of age, accept full responsibility for all
            obligations under this Agreement and create a general sub-account
            for use by a person under the age of 18.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              By accepting the terms of this Agreement, you represent that you
              are an adult 18 years of age or older.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are the Account Holder who purchased a License (“Purchasing
              Account Holder”), you may permit other individuals to access and
              use the Game by providing a Sub-License Code created by you,
              however, you agree that you are liable for all activities
              conducted in connection with the Sub-License Code, that you will
              only permit a minor child or children to use the Sub-License Code
              under your supervision and that you will not provide personal
              information of anyone less than 18 years of age unless that person
              is your child or of which you are legal guardian.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are accepting this Agreement on behalf of an institution,
              company or other legal entity you represent and warrant that you
              have the authority to enter into this Agreement on that
              institution, company or other legal entity’s behalf and you intend
              to bind institution, company or other legal entity hereto. The
              terms “you, “your” and similar variants in this Agreement include
              both you and the institution, company or other legal entity.
            </li>
            <li>
              HartCode may suspend, terminate, modify, or delete the Account at
              any time for any reason, with or without notice to you. Most
              Account suspensions, terminations, and/or deletions are the result
              of violations of this Agreement or are a result of an abandoned
              Account.

            <h3>Financial Transactions On the Account.</h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that HartCode is authorized, but not
            required, to act on payment instructions received from anyone using
            the Account. You authorize HartCode to (a) initiate debits or
            charges against your financial account or credit card periodically
            for the amount then due for purchases made; and (b) initiate any
            other debits or credits authorized by you or anyone using the
            Account registered to you. All payments must be made in U.S. dollars
            from a U.S. bank or via alternative payment methods made available
            by HartCode. You acknowledge that transactions may be facilitated by
            a third party payment processor (the “Processor”), and agree that
            HartCode may share your information, including information about
            your financial accounts, with the Processor, for this purpose. All
            amounts paid are non-refundable, except where and to the extent
            required by law.

            <h3>Member Account, Password and Security.</h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            If you create an Account on the HartCode Website, you will receive a
            password and account designation upon completing the registration
            process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
            the password and Account, and are fully responsible for all
            activities that occur under your password, and Account. When
            creating an account you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate,
            current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the
            registration form (your “Registration Data”); (b) maintain and
            promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate,
            current and complete; (c) immediately notify HartCode of any
            unauthorized use of your password, Account, License Code or
            Sub-License Code or any other breach of security; and (d) ensure
            that you exit from your Account at the end of each session. HartCode
            has the right to suspend or terminate your Account and refuse your
            use of the Service for any reason, including for violations of this
            or any other agreement with HartCode.

          <li>
            <h3>Licenses.</h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            Licenses are available for a varying number of Game as offered on
            the HartCode Website. Each License is a non-exclusive,
            non-transferable (except as expressly provided through use of
            Sub-License Codes), non-assignable, revocable limited license
            subject to the limitations of this Agreement and use of the Service
            for your own non-commercial entertainment purposes. If you believe
            that your License Code has been lost, stolen, or is being abused,
            please contact HartCode at contact@hartcode.com and a new License
            Code may be issued if appropriate as determined by the sole
            discretion of HartCode. Fees for Licenses will be charged in
            accordance to the fees and any additional terms published on the
            HartCode Website. The License begins when it is purchased and it
            will continue until the Game is retired or the Account or License is
            terminated. Games may be retired at any time for any reason, with or
            without notice to you, in HartCode’s sole discretion. Most Game
            retirements will commence when use of the Game wanes and/or a new
            version of the underlying game is offered such that it is no longer
            beneficial to continue to support the older Game. Upon retirement of
            the Game for your License, you will no longer be able to access the
            game. You acknowledge and agree that you are not entitled to any
            refund for any amounts paid or pre-paid in connection with the
            Account upon retirement of a Game.
          </p>
          <p>
            You understand and agree that you have no interest, monetary or
            otherwise, in any feature or content contained in the Game,
            including without limitation, the Account registered to you, in-game
            items or currency or anything of value in the real world without
            HartCode’s express written consent.
          </p>
          <p>Additionally, you may not:</p>

              Otherwise use the Software or the Service except as expressly
              provided in this Agreement. You should keep your License Codes,
              passwords, and other Account information in a safe place.

              and the Service not expressly addressed in this Agreement,
              including without limitation, all rights of reproduction,
              modification, distribution, display, disassembly and decompilation
              and all copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret and other

            <h3>Sub-License Codes.</h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            Each License is associated with a License Code that is used to
            access the License on the HartCode Website. Each License is
            authorized for a maximum number of concurrent non-purchasing users,
            e.g. students, (“Users”), meaning that those Users can all access
            the Game at the same time. To allow Users to use the Game, the
            Purchasing Account Holder may create Sub-License Codes and provide
            them to the Users. Each Sub-License Code will only be effective for
            a term. The current term for any Sub-License Code is two (2) months,
            after which the Sub-License Code will expire. HartCode reserves the
            right to adjust the term for any Sub-License Code at any time for
            any reason, with or without notice to you, in its sole discretion.
            At any time, including at expiration of a Sub-License Code, the
            Purchasing Account Holder may create new or additional Sub-License
            Codes, e.g. to provide access to different Users during the course
            of the License, but in no event may the number of active Sub-License
            Codes exceed the maximum number of Users authorized for a License.
            Exceeding the maximum number of Users authorized for a License may
            result in termination of the associated License or suspension or
            disabling of your Account. If you believe that one of your
            Sub-License Codes has been lost, stolen, or is being abused, please
            contact HartCode at contact@hartcode.com.

            An Account Holder, e.g. a teacher, may provide information to
            HartCode, such as student directory data and performance statistics,
            which may be interpreted as an educational record (“Directory
            Information”) under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
            (“FERPA”). FERPA permits disclosure of Directory Information, but
            requires schools to tell parents and eligible students about
            Directory Information disclosed and allow parents and eligible
            students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not
            disclose Directory Information. If you are an Account Holder and
            provide HartCode such Directory Information through the Website,
            Game or Service, you hereby by represent and warrant that you have
            complied with FERPA including informing parents and eligible
            students about the disclosure of Directory Information and allow

              A statement under penalty of perjury that the Account Holder has a
              good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a
              result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be
              removed or disabled.
